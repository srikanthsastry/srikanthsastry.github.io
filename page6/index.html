<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the fifth, and final, post in my series of notes on unit tests. So far, we've talked about how unit tests help us in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="documenting our code (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/merits-of-unit-tests-part-1/" target="_blank">documenting our code</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="reliably refactor software (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/the-merits-of-unit-tests-part-2/" target="_blank">reliably refactor software</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="build better code (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/the-merits-of-unit-tests-part-3/" target="_blank">build better code</a>, and even <a href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/unit-tests-ftw-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="help debugging in prod (opens in a new tab)">help debugging in prod</a>.  In this post, we'll discuss how unit tests (more precisely, the act of  writing unit tests) help us improve the usability of our code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Usability</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is fairly accurate to state that the simpler and more usable your 
API is, the less likely it is to be misunderstood, misused, and abused. 
Also, simpler API constrains your possible code paths making it more 
testable and less bug-prone. I claim that the very act of making unit 
tests will help you write more usable code/API. (Of course, this assumes
 an earnest effort in writing good quality unit tests, which can be a 
topic of discussion in its own right).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason for my claim is simple, by writing extensive unit tests 
that account for all your use cases, you effectively become your own 
first customer. This forces you you to wear your customer's hat and 
really probe the user experience of your API. In fact, it is not 
uncommon for me to iterate on my APIs multiple times simply because I am
 not happy with how difficult it is to set up and execute my unit tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>
  by writing extensive unit tests that account for all your use cases, you effectively become your own first customer 
</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take a fictional example of a class that does the following: It
 retrieves either a URL, or the content of the URL for a given handle 
that could potentially need to be authenticated as a specific user, and 
it can do so periodically. Here is a first crack at the API and usage 
for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class UrlRetriever {<br />   // Unauthenticated, one-time<br />   UrlRetriever(Handle handle);<br />   // Authenticated, one-time<br />   UrlRetriever(String user, Handle handle);<br />   // Authenticated, periodic<br />   UrlRetriever(String user, Handle handler, int periodInSeconds);<br />   // Unauthenticated, periodic<br />   UrlRetriever(Handle handler, int periodInSeconds);<br />   <br />   String getUrl();<br />   Blob getContents();<br />   void getContentsPeriodically(Callback cb);<br />   void getUrlPeriodically(Callback cb)<br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you start writing unit tests for this, you start seeing issues 
with usability. For example, you have to consider all possible 
constructions of UrlRetriever with getUrl() or getContents() call. 
Worse, what happens if the UrlRetriever is constructed without a 
periodInSeconds argument, and someone invokes getContentsPeriodically() 
on it? Sure, it is nonsensical, but you still need a test case for it, 
right? Which means, the clients could potentially misuse the class in 
this fashion, in part because the usability of this API is poor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making an honest attempt at writing unit tests can actually help you 
detect such usability issues! Consider the next iteration for the same 
use case, informed (or constrained) by the unit tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class UrlRetriever {<br />   UrlRetriever(Handle handle);<br />   AuthenticatedUrlRetriever withAuth(String user);<br />   String getUrl();<br />   Blob getContents();<br />   void getPeriodically(ContentCallback cb, int periodInSeconds);<br />   void getPeriodically(UrlCallback cb, int periodInSeconds); <br />} <br />class AuthenticatedUrlRetriever inherits UrlRetriever {<br />   // Does not make sense to authenticate with another user.<br />   AuthenticatedUrlRetriever withAuth(String user) throws exception;<br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will see that writing unit tests for it is much easier, and 
furthermore, there is less chance of misusing this API. Both of this is 
true because the API is more usable. The clients can use it in multiple,
 but limited/tractable. Here is how it ends up looking in the unit 
tests. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// one-time unauthenticated <br />url = UrlRetriever(handle).getUrl();<br /> // periodic unauthenticated (1)<br /> // -- MyCallback inherits UrlCallback.<br />urlCallback = new MyCallback(); <br />UrlRetriever(handle).getPeriodically(urlCallback, 30);<br />  // periodic unauthenticated (2)<br /> // -- MyCallback inherits ContentCallback. <br />contentCallback = new MyCallback(); UrlRetriever(handle).getPeriodically(contentCallback, 30);<br />  // Authenticated<br />foo = UrlRetriever(handle).withAuth(user);<br /> //  -- one-time<br />blob = foo.getContents();<br /> //  -- periodic <br />foo.getPeriodically(contentCallback, 60); </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<p>Much better eh? :)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the previous three  parts of this series, I have talked about how unit tests are useful in a  lot more than just verifying that your code works. We've talked its  uses for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="documentation (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/merits-of-unit-tests-part-1/" target="_blank">documentation</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="refactoring and code health (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/the-merits-of-unit-tests-part-2/" target="_blank">refactoring and code health</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="writing better software (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/the-merits-of-unit-tests-part-3/" target="_blank">writing better software</a>. Next, we'll see how unit tests helps you debug issues in production. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Debugging </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single unit test is supposed to test a single code path within your
 class. I don't always follow this maxim, but it is nevertheless a very 
good rule of thumb. Given that the number of code paths within a given 
code if often increases exponentially with the size of the code, unit 
tests are often a lot more lines of code than the actual production code
 itself. This is a good thing when it comes to debugging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your unit tests cover sufficiently many code paths (which any good
 unit test suite should do), then when an issue arises in production, 
and you narrow it down to your code, then you know that the offending 
code path could not have been the several code paths that your unit 
tests already covered. This pruning makes your debugging a lot simpler 
than before.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's go back to the example I gave you in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/merits-unit-tests-part-3-srikanth-sastry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 3</a>.
 Here is that piece of code. Recall that it takes a large query, splits 
it up into multiple subqueries, sends them off in parallel, collects 
their responses back, munges them and returns the munged response to the
 caller via a callback </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public class QueryManager {<br />   void sendRequest(Query query, Callback queryCallback) {<br />     List&lt;Subquery&gt; subqueries = splitQuery(query);<br />     for (Subquery subquery : subqueries) {<br />       sendQuery(subquery, new Subquery.Callback() {<br />           @Override<br />           public onSuccess(Response response) {<br />             // Do some processing. ...<br />             if (allResponses()) {<br />               queryCallback.finalResult();<br />              } else {<br />                queryCallback.incrementalResult();<br />              }<br />            }<br />            @Override<br />            public onFailure(Error e) {<br />              // Do some error handling. ... <br />              if (allResponses()) {<br />                queryCallback.finalResult();<br />              }<br />            }<br />          });<br />     }<br />   }<br />     // Other methods. ... <br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ran into this code because of an issue that we were seeing in production. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every so often the logs showed a really really long query that timed 
out, but it did manage to serve the response back to the user. Digging 
into it some more, I managed to narrow it down to this class. But beyond
 that, things were a mystery. Recall that in my last post I mentioned 
how there were no unit tests here, and the code actually needed 
refactoring to pull out the anonymous class. We pick up the story here 
after all that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I had all the unit tests put in, I discovered that the root cause for the bug is actually a race condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The unit tests had ruled out sufficiently many code paths to lead me 
to a strong suspicion that it was a race condition in the allresponses()
 function causing two overlapping 'last' responses to both trigger the 
incrementalResult() callback function, and so the finalResult() method 
was never invoked. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have a candidate cause, reproducing and verifying it becomes
 pretty straightforward (not necessarily easy or simple, but 
straightforward), and the rest is just mundane software engineering. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See, unit tests are more than a one trick pony! :)</p>

<p>Previously, I talked about how unit tests serve purposes other than verifying code functionality; I talked about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/merits-of-unit-tests-part-1/" target="_blank">unit tests serving as defacto documentation</a>, and <a href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/the-merits-of-unit-tests-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">unit tests helping you refactor without fear</a>. In this post, I'll talk about yet another benefit to unit tests: writing better software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Better software design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am not talking about writing bug-free software here. Sure, good 
unit tests help you discover/avoid large classes of bugs, but that's not
 the point. Unit tests also help you enforce good design patterns and 
modularity in your software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unit tests help you with software design in two complementary ways. 
First, they help you establish optimal boundaries of modularity in terms
 of methods, and classes, and second, they help you understand your 
dependencies better and almost force you to use good dependency 
injection hygiene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Modularity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":386} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you know that your class or method does 'too much', or that it
 has undesirable side-effects? A pretty good way to discover it is to 
start writing unit tests for it. If you find yourself having to test for
 too many different types of inputs, then your methods are doing too 
much. If you find yourself having to test for too many orderings of 
operations, when your methods have too many side effects. It really is 
just as simple as that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, some time ago, I came across a piece of code that 
essentially took a large query, split it up into multiple subqueries, 
sent them off in parallel, collected their responses back, munged them 
and returned the munged response to the caller via a callback. The code 
looked something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public class QueryManager {<br />   void sendRequest(Query query, Callback queryCallback) {<br />     List&lt;Subquery&gt; subqueries = splitQuery(query);<br />     for (Subquery subquery : subqueries) {<br />       sendQuery(subquery, new Subquery.Callback() {<br />           @Override<br />           public onSuccess(Response response) {<br />             // Do some processing. ...<br />             if (allResponses()) {<br />               queryCallback.finalResult();<br />              } else {<br />                queryCallback.incrementalResult();<br />              }<br />            }<br />            @Override<br />            public onFailure(Error e) {<br />              // Do some error handling. ... <br />              if (allResponses()) {<br />                queryCallback.finalResult();<br />              }<br />            }<br />          });<br />     }<br />   }<br />     // Other methods. ... <br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This code makes for an interesting case study on multiple fronts, and  I will come back to it in a later post. For now, it is sufficient to  state that I wanted to make changes to this code, but it was pretty  thorny because (you guessed it!) it has no unit tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naturally, the first step is to write unit tests for this class, and 
that was when I realized why there were no unit tests here. This class 
is incredibly tricky to unit test. Getting the subqueries to respond 
under various conditions and ordering resulted in a combinatorial 
explosion of test cases making the task intractable. This was very 
strong code smell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you have probably figured out already, this was a classic case of a
 single class doing too much. The primary culprit was the anonymous 
class that implemented the Subquery.Callback interface. It should really
 have been its own class with its own unit tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After I pulled out that anonymous class into its own class, it became
 a lot easier to unit test both the Subquery.Callback and the 
QueryManager individually, and with that, the code became much more 
modular, easier to read, and much easier to maintain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Dependency</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":387} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-387" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your code does not do a decent job of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> injecting its dependencies</a>
 from outside, you are gonna have a bad time! Having good unit tests 
will actually keep you from getting into this pitfall pretty 
effectively. Consider the following contrived example. You have a piece 
of code that writes to an external service, and your code throttles the 
rate of writes because going over your approved rate/quota can be pretty
 expensive. So, your code could look something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class RateLimiter {<br />   void writeToExternalService(const vector&lt;Entries&gt;&amp; stuff) {<br />     auto service = new ExternalService(ConnectionParameters foo);<br />     for (auto entry : stuff) {<br />       waitUntilQuotaAvailable();<br />       service.write(entry);<br />     }<br />   }<br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember how I said that going over the rate/quota is bad? How do you
 verify that it will not happen? Well, you could set up an elaborate 
testbed that has an ExternalService simulator, and you can run your code
 through all sorts of inputs and verify that the simulator says that the
 rate limiting is work. But that's expensive, and if you choose to go 
with a different external service, then well, good luck with that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, you could try to unit test it. But how? You need to have 
access to the ExternalService to do that, which we have already 
established is expensive! Well, this is where unit testing it will force
 you into healthy dependency injection. For this contrived example, you 
can inject the dependency as follows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class RateLimiter {<br />   void writeToExternalService(<br />       const vector&lt;Entries&gt;&amp; stuff, <br />       ExternalService service) {<br />     for (auto entry : stuff) {<br />       waitUntilQuotaAvailable();<br />       service.write(entry);<br />     }<br />   }<br />} </pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your unit tests could do this:</p>

        The merits of unit tests — Part 2

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the <a href="http://srikanth.sastry.name/merits-of-unit-tests-part-1/">previous post</a>,  we saw how unit tests can serve as a reliable source of documentation  for your code. There is a lot more that unit tests can do for you. In this post I'll talk about a fairly obvious, but often ignored, benefit  to unit testing: Refactoring.</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Refactoring is a less than pleasant, nevertheless, essential part of 
developing and maintaining high quality software. No matter how well 
designed your software is, over time a few things happen to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. The assumptions you made about the environment change, and that triggers unanticipated changes to your code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":375,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2011-05-16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dt_c110516-1024x319.gif" alt="Boss: Did I remember to tell you before you finished the coding that the user's specifications changed? Dilbert: AAAIII-YIIIII-YIIII-YIII!!! Boss: So, no-ish? Dilbert: BAM! BAM! BAM! " class="wp-image-375" /></a></figure>

<p><em>You started with the assumption that every account will have a 
unique username, but with the introduction of shared family-accounts, 
this may not be true anymore.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. New/junior engineers make changes to the code that run antithetical to the original design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":376} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376" /></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While you were out on vacation, your colleague's intern made a 
less-than well thought out change to add an session expiry feature to 
your code with a bunch of if-checks that see if the session has not 
already expired. By the the time you returned from your vacation, this 
code has been in production for two weeks, and you have more important 
things to do.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. The software is co-opted for something that it was never intended for in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":377,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://www.gorillafabrication.com/modifications/16-repurposed-trucks-and-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377" /></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That awesome geo-spatial indexing service that you wrote for 
indexing cities became so popular that it is now being used to index 
stores in malls across the country, and to accommodate that, the schema 
now includes fields such as 'store name', 'floor number', etc. which 
make no sense in your original use case; it has just been shoehorned 
here.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time any of those things happen, you accrue some tech debt, and
 eventually the tech debt gets so high that it start impeding your 
ability to make future changes. This is the point at which you have to 
redesign your software to reflect the new world it is in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my experience, one of the most delicate things about refactoring 
such code is that you often have to rewrite the software but keep all of
 its existing behavior intact. Any failure to do so will start 
triggering failures in the system-at-large. Having good unit tests can 
be an indispensable asset. If, throughout the evolution of your 
software, there has been a diligent effort to keep the unit tests up to 
date and with sufficient code/path coverage, the task of refactoring 
becomes a lot easier.</p>

<p>Good unit tests can save you multiple days or even weeks of making 
incremental changes and testing them out in production in a gingerly 
fashion in ensure that nothing breaks.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons to write unit tests. Verification is only one of them, and the least interesting. This is part 1 of a five part series on why you should write unit tests (apart from the obvious): Documentation!</p>

<p>We have all heard this 
repeatedly: “You have to have unit tests. Unit tests are how you find 
issues in your code and fix them before they hit the trunk.” Ok, so that
 argument sounded a little weak. Here is a much stronger version of the 
same argument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>You have to write unit tests because unit tests are a </em><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FScientific_method&amp;h=ATNU99lLyWx55l8BBlgT8AIDwdfUHBUjrSOtbRUQbP42vH_k7pVzTOXviC2N0Ze44RbFVdkFCWKSsvNoCovWLh8gaOuHG9eEAsu4GKloIbcHKwPbQdRFAdhFdNCPSDHmdBjCaYcBKEXAxhC-i735nThHQPOCEuD39p2iuu6K8bulWw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>scientific</em></a><em>
 mechanism to verify that your implementation satisfies the 
specification (that is, you code does what you say it does). To 
elaborate, your claim of what your code does is a </em><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFalsifiability&amp;h=ATPEcKK4eeXOCNWcc8BCYwdplxHx1zCDAuE74Z4TapMJOVwgCqukHCEuH21QaLSEGYvUA1ouxan-XttxS4n2cgnjJBzJY5CWV-quFVTNq18bpJSTq2l3NZyjuw2yd1-O3mWdupeKygwazafitDpYrhAWIt8nLBIlTkuxKG0nTn0oSA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>falsifiable</em></a><em>
 hypothesis in that it is possible to conceive of an observation that 
could negate your claim. Unit tests are the experiments that can be 
performed to test your hypothesis. If all your unit tests pass, then it 
is increasingly likely that your claim is correct. (Note that we cannot 
claim to have proved correctness; that is an impossible task in the 
general case).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This still an unsatisfying argument at best. What if I were a perfect
 developer who writes perfect code, and everyone around me agrees that I
 write perfect code. Do I still need to write unit tests? Or what about 
the cases where visual inspection of the code makes correctness obvious.
 Do I still need to spend precious time writing unit tests?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While verification is an important reason to have unit tests, IMHO, 
it is also the least interesting. There are many more reasons to be 
rigorous about unit tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with my favorite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":370,"align":"center","linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3t1i87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="http://srikanth.sastry.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a0a8c4ab0bec170a748228f0982da6795e6af515a8048b11c2b4c9e794d7b4f9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-370" /></a></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unit tests makes the best documentation for your code. We were all 
hired as software engineers because we can write good software. That 
means a lot of us are not very good at technical writing, and for many 
of us, English isn't our native tongue. This creates barriers for us in 
communicating what our software does so that others can use it well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We could write wiki/docs describing what our code does, but that has three major issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>The documentation doesn't live anywhere near the code, and so discoverability is difficult</li><li>English is not the primary language for a lot of us, and technical 
writing is not our strong suit, and so the quality of the writing can be
 suspect</li><li>As the code evolves, the documentation becomes obsolete. The only thing worse than no documentation is wrong documentation!</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We could write comments in the code itself. So discoverability is not
 a problem. However, the other two issues still remain. (Raise your hand
 if you have seen comments that are out of sync with the code that it is
 supposed to clarify.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we could really use it a mechanism that leverages our strength 
(writing software) to create documentation, and automation to ensure 
that documentation is never obsolete. Unit tests turn out to be the 
perfect tool for this!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of each unit test as a how-do example of how to use your code. 
So, if anyone wants to use the code that your wrote, all they need to do
 is look at your unit tests, the job is done!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great example is the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">folly</a> library. Let's take folly Futures for instance. The primary header file <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/futures/Future.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future.h</a> tells you the API, but figuring out how to use it is not straightforward from there. However, go over to the unit tests at <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffacebook%2Ffolly%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Ffolly%2Ffutures%2Ftest%2FFutureTest.cpp&amp;h=ATNiTV-rdTNS1lEjxiC29ETboF-w94bQpQhXUxFugGI897McF_YyCo-jvJX_kzLzDyVSjokYlYY9wbhcS4dJsTQlrgkVGXW8Fw7BBKx537cGoHDELiJcF4gBHMQq2CzZXV158ToPWPV0j0Xbt4WNDiLY13bFtRv7cWPEgKLJZsHe0Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FutureTest.cpp</a>,
 and you will come away knowing how to use Futures for your use case in a
 matter of minutes. For each minute spent by a folly developer to write 
these unit tests, it has saved thousands of developers countless hours.</p>
