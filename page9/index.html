        Failure Detectors Encapsulate Fairness

    <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>The full version of my OPODIS 2010 paper “Failure Detectors Encapsulate Fairness” (<a href="documents/research/opodis2010.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>) has been accepted for publication with the journal Distributed Computing. You can find a <a href="/documents/research/journal/FD_encapsulate_fairness_preprint.pdf" target="_blank">preprint of the paper here [pdf]</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><em><strong>Abstract: </strong></em>Failure detectors have long been viewed as abstractions for the synchronism present in distributed system models. However, investigations into the exact amount of synchronism encapsulated by a given failure detector have met with limited success. The reason for this is that traditionally, models of partial synchrony are specified with respect to real time, but failure detectors do not encapsulate real time. Instead, we argue that failure detectors encapsulate the fairness in computation and communication. Fairness is a measure of the number of steps executed by one process relative either to the number of steps taken by another process or relative to the duration for which a message is in transit. We argue that failure detectors are substitutable for the fairness properties (rather than real-time properties) of partially synchronous systems. We propose four fairness-based models of partial synchrony and demonstrate that they are, in fact, the ‘weakest system models’ to implement the canonical failure detectors from the Chandra-Toueg hierarchy. We also propose a set of fairness-based models which encapsulate the $Gc$ parametric failure detectors which eventually and permanently suspect crashed processes, and eventually and permanently trust some fixed set of c correct processes.</p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2011</span>

    <p>I was in Tunisia in the second week of December in 2010. Just a week before the popular uprising ripped the political system apart and dethroned the dictator <a title="Wikipedia Article on Ben Ali" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali">Ben Ali</a>. I have tried to capture my visit as a photo essay of Tunisia just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Tunisian_revolution">revolution</a>. The essay is divided into multiple parts: Tunis, Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, photographs from the subsharan desert near Tozeur, the nearby mountain oases, a salt lake, and a visit to the sets of the Phantom Menace.</p>

<p>Of course, no visit to Tunisia is complete without a visit to the famous Roman baths. So that’s where we head next.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Roman Baths" />

<p>The Roman baths were, no doubt, magnificent. But very little of it’s super structure remains.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From Tunis, my visit took me to Tozeur, a desert village in southern Tunisia.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Tozeur" />

<h3>Tozeur</h3>
<p>There isn’t much in Tozeur itself. But it is a great starting place for visiting some beautiful locations including  the salt lake Chott el-Jerid, a few mountain oases including Chebika, and of course, the set of the Star Wars movie The Phantom Menace.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>Chott el-Jerid</h4>
<p><img title="We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2738.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose.</p>

<p>Anyway, moving on… next, we come to the mountain oasis Chebika.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Chebika" />

<p> </p>
<h3>Chebika</h3>
<p><img title="We had to drive 30 minutes or so into the Saharan desert to get to Chebika." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2694.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We had to drive 30 minutes or so into the Saharan desert to get to Chebika.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From Chebika, we wanted to make it to another oasis, Medis, but it was getting pretty late.</p>

<p><img title="But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2706.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown.</p>

<p>But alas, like eveything else. This visit too had to come to an end. And thank god it did in the nick of time. I flew out of Tunis on December 19th. The <a title="Wikipedia article: Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi">self immolation</a> that triggered the revolution was on December 17th in Sidi Bouzid (not to be confused with Sidi Bou Said).</p>

<p><strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong></p>

<p>Algorithms in message-passing distributed systems often require <em>partial synchrony</em> to tolerate crash failures. Informally, partial synchrony refers to systems where timing bounds on communication and computation may exist, but the knowledge of such bounds is limited. Traditionally, the foundation for the theory of partial synchrony has been <em>real time</em>: a time base measured by counting events external to the system, like the vibrations of Cesium atoms or piezoelectric crystals.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, algorithms that are correct relative to many real-time based models of partial synchrony may not behave correctly in empirical distributed systems. For example, a set of popular theoretical models, which we call M<em>, assume (eventual) upper bounds on message delay and relative process speeds, regardless of message size and absolute process speeds. Empirical systems with bounded channel capacity and bandwidth cannot realize such assumptions either natively, or through algorithmic constructions. Consequently, empirical deployment of the many M</em>-based algorithms risks anomalous behavior.</p>

<p>As a result, we argue that real time is the wrong basis for such a theory. Instead, the appropriate foundation for partial synchrony is {\em fairness}: a time base measured by counting events internal to the system, like the steps executed by the processes. By way of example, we redefine M* models with fairness-based bounds and provide algorithmic techniques to implement fairness-based M* models on a significant subset of the empirical systems. The proposed techniques use <em>failure detectors</em> — system services that provide hints about process crashes — as intermediaries that preserve the fairness constraints native to empirical systems. In effect, algorithms that are correct in M* models are now proved correct in such empirical systems as well.</p>

<p>Demonstrating our results requires solving three open problems. (1) We propose the first unified mathematical framework based on Timed I/O Automata to specify empirical systems, partially synchronous systems, and algorithms that execute within the aforementioned systems. (2) We show that crash tolerance capabilities of popular distributed systems can be denominated exclusively through fairness constraints. (3) We specify exemplar system models that identify the set of weakest system models to implement popular failure detectors.</p>

<p>I thank my advisors Scott Pike and Jennifer Welch for all their help, support, and guidance.</p>

        Proposing a new radio show
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2008</span>

    <p>I am proposing a new music show on <a title="KEOS" href="http://www.keos.org/" target="_self">KEOS 89.1FM</a> Community Radio. Below is the proposal I will be submitting to the KEOS mangement team.</p>

<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" />

<p align="center"><b>  KEOS Show Proposal</b></p>
<p><i><b>Name:</b></i> Srikanth Sastry<i><b>
Date:</b></i> August 27, 2008<i><b>
Show Description:</b></i> I propose a music show focusing exclusively on Trance music. The show will showcase various sub genres of trance including Progressive Trance, Acid Trance, Psychedelic Trance, Vocal Trance, Ambient Trance, and such. The show will feature artists like ATB, Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke, Tiesto, Robert Miles, Astral Projection, Buddha Bar, and such. The nature of trance music and the associated culture is such that it favors long sessions of continuous music, so the show will have very few breaks. All the mandated PSAs, promos, and station ID will either be played together so as to provide a longer continuous music session, or will be played over the music (the music will be potted down, of course). Since this makes it difficult to communicate the play-list to the listeners I propose serve the play-list online.</p>

<hr id="system-readmore" />

<p><i><b>Show Format:</b></i> It will be a 2 hr. show consisting of ~30-minute sessions of continuous music.
<i><b>Audience:</b></i> Anyone interested in trance music, or is curious about it. There is a significant minority counter/alternative culture in the B/CS area who listen to trance, house, and ambient music. Unfortunately the airways carry very little music in those genres. I expect this program to fill that void, at least partially.
<i><b>Longevity:</b></i> Trance is an extremely active music genre. Having developed in the 1990s, it is a relatively new form of music. Despite its nascence Trance DJs are extremely prolific in their creations and several artists release albums every year, not to mention recordings from various trance festivals and jam sessions. Although trance is not very well known in the US, it is extremely popular in Europe and shows no signs of waning down.
<i><b>Fidelity to KEOS Mission:</b></i> This show will play music from a genre that is chronically and acutely underplayed on all radio stations. Its audience includes a demographic which is severely under-served on the Bryan-College Station airwaves. The show has the potential to attract new listener-ship to KEOS, thus diversifying both the music played on the station, and the people who listen to KEOS.
<i><b>Resources:</b></i> I have legal copies of all the music that I’d like to play on the air. I need only the resources already available in the On-Air studio for my show. Wireless Internet would be a desirable, but not necessary, resource.
<i><b>Suggested Titles:</b></i> Trance Texas Corridor; Trance Nocturna; Alchemical Hours; Android Dreams; One Nation Under Trance
<i><b>Possible Time Slots:</b></i> Monday 11PM-1AM; Tuesday 9-11PM. 11PM-1AM
<i><b>Co-Hosting:</b></i> Currently, I do not have a co-host, but am open to the idea of having one. My backup, in case I cannot host during some weeks, is Martin Codrington.
<i><b>Start Date:</b></i> First week of October</p>

    <p>It was the Thankgiving Week in November 2007, and I was not about to make the same mistake I did before. Staying back in College Station over Thanksgiving is one of the most depressing experiences. The entire town and TAMU campus is deserted. You feel like the sole survivor in a post-apocalyptic world. My brother, Shankar, was visiting me for the Thanksgiving break, I and I was not about to subject him to Thanksgiving in College Station. So yeah, I was definitely going out somewhere that wasn’t College Station.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It was decided that Shankar and I will go camping in  Big Bend National Park. Its a 10 hour drive each way, and a two day stay in the park. So we stacked up on our supplies, and started out on November 27th at 8 in the morning. It was an uneventful drive up through to Fredericksburg going west. Once we got past Fredericksburg and headed out towards west Texas, I realized how flat the Texas landscape truly is. I could see flat straight roads for miles without an change in the geography! One could fall asleep at the wheel, wake up minutes later and not even realize it!</p>

<p>It was fairly late by the time we got to Ft. Stockton, and so we decided to spend the night at a motel there, and left for Big Bend first thing in the morning. The drive from Ft. Stockton to Big Bend was quite picturesque. There were some very interesting natural and man-made reliefs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We reached the borders to Big Bend National Park at about 8 in the morning. Although I knew it was called the ‘Big’ Bend, I didn’t quite realize how BIG it really is! We has to drive to over 40 miles into the Big Bend National Park to get to our campground. The campground was located in a basin surrounded by the Chisos Mountains. It was an extremely picturesque location to camp out at.</p>
<div align="center">

<div align="center">Chisos Mountains</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>When we got there the campground was almost full. However, we did manage to secure a decent camp site, and then set out for our first hike: the window trail.</p>

<p>The window trail is a 5 mile round trip trail that takes you a ‘window ‘ created by water erosion. The window  is a pour-off that drains the entire Chisos basin into the great Chihuahuan desert. Although it was not a very difficult hike, we were woefully out of shape, and so it seemed a lot more difficult then it should be. We started off form the campground with a beautiful view of the canyon beyond which lay the ‘window’.</p>
<div align="center">

<div align="center">View of the Canyon that ends at the 'window'</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The hike was peppered with some unusual looking plants. Like this snake-like plant:</p>

<div align="center">Closer to the Window</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>And there was more to see, like this beautiful grass patch:</p>

<div align="center">Grassy Patch</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>Some ‘interesting’ geological formations like this one:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>and a Roadrunner  running through it:</p>

<div align="center">Roadrunner</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>About 2 hours later, we got to the the ‘window’. A breathtaking view of a 200 feet drop of the stream into the Chihuahuan desert</p>

<div align="center">The Window</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>Although we got back at about 3 PM or so, we were really tired. Just an indication of how out of shape we were! We set out tent up and crashed for an hour and a half or so. By then, it was too late to start another hike. Sunset was in less than an hour. Instead I took stock of the Chisos Basin itself. It was quite a sight to behold. Behind our campsite was the Casa Grande:</p>
<div align="center">

<div align="center">Casa Grande</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was nightfall soon, and the temperature was dropping fast. We’d know the next day that the temperature that night has down to 24F! Since Big Bend is so far away from all civilization, there is virtually no bright light sources (like headlights, street lights, buildings etc.) at night. The moon was shining bright, bathing the entire basin in the pale white moonlight. I did my best to capture it on camera:</p>
<div align="center">

<hr title="Hiking Emory Peak" />

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks to the freezing cold night, it was painfully difficult to wake up early the next day. The temperature at 8AM was a biting 28F! With great effort we managed to wake up, get freshened up for what was by our standards, a mammoth task. We decided to hike to the Emory Peak: the highest point in the Big Bend. It was a towering 7845ft above sea-level. Chisos Basin is at about 5200ft. So we were gaining over 2500ft in 4.5 miles. It was a 9 mile round trip hike. Thanks to the preparatory 5-mile hike to the ‘Window’ the previous day, and a good night sleep, we were in a position to do this one.</p>

<p>The biggest adversary in hikes like these is not the distance (coz’ its short), not the incline (‘coz its not too bad); the worst is the altitude and the rate at which the altitude increases. The air is pretty thin (compared to seas level), and keeps getting thinner as you go up. So you are constantly out of breath. But the time you are acclimatised to a particular altitude, you have hiked higher, and so you are still out of breath.</p>

<p>We had to stop every 50 steps or so to catch our breath. I was not a happy camper about that. But each rest stop gave us something beautiful to admire. Like this view of Casa Grande:</p>
<div align="center">

<div align="center">Berries</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>We even had fall colors there!</p>

<div align="center">Fall Colors</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>We finally got to a point above Casa Grande. Emory Peak wasn’t too far off.</p>

<div align="center">Looking down at Casa Grande</div>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>After rock climbing the last 60 ft. we go to the top of Emory peak. The view from above was breath taking! To the south was the vast expanse of Mexico.</p>

<p>Two hours later, we were back at our campsite and it was 5:30 in the evening. Close to sunset.</p>

<p>Another cold night (this time braving 20F) later, we were up at 8 in the morning and headed out. Back on the road. Back on the flat roads of west Texas, back towards hill country, and then College Station. Back towards civilization.</p>
