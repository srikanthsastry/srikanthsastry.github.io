Welcome!

I am Srikanth Sastry. I am currently occupied as a software engineer at Google in New York City (since April 2013). Before that I was a postdoctoral associate with Nancy Lynch at CSAIL, MIT. I received my PhD from Texas A&amp;M University; my advisors were Jennifer Welch and Scott Pike.

My research interests include distributed systems, networking, fault tolerance, and algorithm design and analysis. My list of publications are available here.
