I had a really good time visiting Mira's family in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevlievo">Sevlievo, Bulgaria</a>. It is considered one of wealthiest towns in Bulgaria, and it does looks the part. Despite being a really small town with a population of less than 30,000, it looks remarkably well kept.

We started with visiting the old St. Prophet Eliah Church.

<!--more-->The last place I was allowed to take photos was the entrance. It was pretty quaint on the inside, but we were not allowed to take any pictures.

Next, we headed to the city center. The old town. Not the most happening place, but nice nevertheless. Here is a sample of small-town Bulgarian life.

As it turns out, there is a mosque in town, but only muslims are allowed in. So this is pretty much all I got to see.

Interestingly, Sevlievo is also home to <a href="http://www.bulgariainside.eu/en/articles/Sevlievos-Clock-Tower/542/1">one of the oldest clock towers</a> in Bulgaria, built in 1777/1779.
