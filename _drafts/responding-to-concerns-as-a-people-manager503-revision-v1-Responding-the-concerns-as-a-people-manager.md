<p>You are the people manager for a team, and a team member comes to you with a concern. What should you do? I have been in this situation multiple times, and have admittedly made some wrong turns. After some corrections and learning, here is what seems to work well for me (although YMMV). If you like lists, here is a snapshot of the path I take.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Listen</li><li>Empathize</li><li>Descend into the particular</li><li>Check with others</li><li>If more than one person expresses the same opinion, socialize it within the team.</li><li>DO NOT become an apologist for status quo.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s unpack each of those bullet points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Listen</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When someone in the team you support talks about how things are not a 100%, just listen. And I mean really listen. Take what they are saying at face value, even if you suspect something else is at play. Be non judgmental. Give full attention here. This is a lot harder than it sounds! Beware of you mind trying to make connections with that you are hearing. Resist that impulse.<br>Repeat back to them what they said, but in your own words. Ask for a confirmation if you have captured their thoughts and feelings well. Rinse and repeat until they respond affirmatively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Empathize</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you know what the team member is talking about, do not respond yet. Stop to empathize with them, or their situation. Even if you do not agree with them, still take the time to understand where they are coming from and why they are feeling the way they are. Talk to them to make sure you do understand where they are coming from. It is important not to come across as someone with all the answers, or worse, with condescension. It is important that the person feels validated and not diminished for sharing what they did share. Not giving them that luxury is a sure way to get them to express themselves less and hold things within themselves until it gets to a point where they decide to leave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Descend into the particular</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After hearing the person out, remain focused on the specific issue they are bringing up. Do not try to generalize. By generalizing you risk losing important details that might be critical to addressing the issue. Also, when it comes to such issues, it helps to solve the exact problem at hand first, and then look to address the general case outside the scope of what the team member is bringing up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Check with others</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t try to solve the issue yet. Check with others to see the issue is more widespread than the single individual. You can bring it up with others, but be sure to respect the original team member’s privacy and discretion.</p>
