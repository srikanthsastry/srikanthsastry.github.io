<a href="http://hitar-petar.com/">Hitar Pitar</a> is a quaint little restaurant and hotel in the village of Beli Osam in Bulgaria (close to the Troyan Monastery). It has a neat collection of decorative artifacts that make for an interesting collection of photos.

The restaurant is located on the banks of the Beli Osam river.

<!--more-->Across the river, on the other bank, we see an interesting decoration; it is a 2.5D fresco/mural of a house, a man on a donkey, a water wheel, and a wooden window A/C unit. Check it out.

At the entrance to the restaurant is a wooden cannon made from the trunk of a cherry tree.

To the right is an outdoor chapel that looks a lot like a small temple in rural india.
