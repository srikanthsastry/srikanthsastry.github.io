  <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2011</span>
  <p>I was in Tunisia in the second week of December in 2010. Just a week before the popular uprising ripped the political system apart and dethroned the dictator <a title="Wikipedia Article on Ben Ali" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali">Ben Ali</a>. I have tried to capture my visit as a photo essay of Tunisia just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Tunisian_revolution">revolution</a>. The essay is divided into multiple parts: Tunis, Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, photographs from the subsharan desert near Tozeur, the nearby mountain oases, a salt lake, and a visit to the sets of the Phantom Menace.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Tunis</h3>

<p>Of course, no visit to Tunisia is complete without a visit to the famous Roman baths. So that’s where we head next.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Roman Baths" />

<p>The Roman baths were, no doubt, magnificent. But very little of it’s super structure remains.</p>

<p><img title="The beautiful pathway to the ruins gives you an inkling of the magnificence that the people of antiquity enjoyed here." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2915.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> The beautiful pathway to the ruins gives you an inkling of the magnificence that the people of antiquity enjoyed here.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From Tunis, my visit took me to Tozeur, a desert village in southern Tunisia.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Tozeur" />

<h3>Tozeur</h3>
<p>There isn’t much in Tozeur itself. But it is a great starting place for visiting some beautiful locations including  the salt lake Chott el-Jerid, a few mountain oases including Chebika, and of course, the set of the Star Wars movie The Phantom Menace.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>Chott el-Jerid</h4>
<p><img title="We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2738.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img title="Of course, we took some time to smell the salt." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2742.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> Of course, we took some time to smell the salt.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img title="But life is tenacious, and manages to find a way to survive even in such harsh, saline conditions. Mind you, the lake dries up to become a salt bed in the summer." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2743.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> But life is tenacious, and manages to find a way to survive even in such harsh, saline conditions. Mind you, the lake dries up to become a salt bed in the summer.</p>

<p><img title="And then I saw this! Who in their right mind thought it smart to place a bus in the middle of a salt lake?!?" src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2756.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> And then I saw this! Who in their right mind thought it smart to place a bus in the middle of a salt lake?!?</p>

<p>Anyway, moving on… next, we come to the mountain oasis Chebika.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr title="Chebika" />

<p> </p>
<h3>Chebika</h3>
<p><img title="We had to drive 30 minutes or so into the Saharan desert to get to Chebika." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2694.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We had to drive 30 minutes or so into the Saharan desert to get to Chebika.</p>

<p><img title="Lots of fossils, quartz, and curious looking crystals (such as the desert rose) that the villagers collect, and they make a living off of selling them to tourists like us." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2806.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> Lots of fossils, quartz, and curious looking crystals (such as the desert rose) that the villagers collect, and they make a living off of selling them to tourists like us.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From Chebika, we wanted to make it to another oasis, Medis, but it was getting pretty late.</p>

<p><img title="But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2706.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img title="We almost made it there, but not quite. We were just a couple of miles away. This road leads straight to Algeria, and Medis was just before the international border. But then, we ran out of time." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2720.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We almost made it there, but not quite.

<p> </p>

<p>After an unsuccessful drive to Medis, we headed out to the dunes and the nerd in me could not  miss out on what was coming next.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But alas, like eveything else. This visit too had to come to an end. And thank god it did in the nick of time. I flew out of Tunis on December 19th. The <a title="Wikipedia article: Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi">self immolation</a> that triggered the revolution was on December 17th in Sidi Bouzid (not to be confused with Sidi Bou Said).</p>
