I was in Tunisia in the second week of December in 2010. Just a week before the popular uprising ripped the political system apart and dethroned the dictator <a title="Wikipedia Article on Ben Ali" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali">Ben Ali</a>. I have tried to capture my visit as a photo essay of Tunisia just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Tunisian_revolution">revolution</a>. The essay is divided into multiple parts: Tunis, Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, photographs from the subsharan desert near Tozeur, the nearby mountain oases, a salt lake, and a visit to the sets of the Phantom Menace.

&nbsp;
<h3>Tunis</h3>

Of course, no visit to Tunisia is complete without a visit to the famous Roman baths. So that's where we head next.

&nbsp;

<hr title="Roman Baths" />

The Roman baths were, no doubt, magnificent. But very little of it's super structure remains.

From Tunis, my visit took me to Tozeur, a desert village in southern Tunisia.

&nbsp;

<hr title="Tozeur" />

<h3>Tozeur</h3>
There isn't much in Tozeur itself. But it is a great starting place for visiting some beautiful locations including  the salt lake Chott el-Jerid, a few mountain oases including Chebika, and of course, the set of the Star Wars movie The Phantom Menace.

&nbsp;
<h4>Chott el-Jerid</h4>
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img title="We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2738.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> We were told that the sunrise over the salt lake is beautiful, so we got there just in time before the sun rose.[/caption]

Anyway, moving on... next, we come to the mountain oasis Chebika.

From Chebika, we wanted to make it to another oasis, Medis, but it was getting pretty late.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img title="But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown." src="/images/stories/travels/tunisia2010/IMG_2706.JPG" alt="" width="800" height="533" border="0" /> But we did manage to get some breathtaking views in our futile attempt to get to Medis before sundown.[/caption]

But alas, like eveything else. This visit too had to come to an end. And thank god it did in the nick of time. I flew out of Tunis on December 19th. The <a title="Wikipedia article: Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi">self immolation</a> that triggered the revolution was on December 17th in Sidi Bouzid (not to be confused with Sidi Bou Said).
