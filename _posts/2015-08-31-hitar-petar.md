<a href="http://hitar-petar.com/">Hitar Pitar</a> is a quaint little restaurant and hotel in the village of Beli Osam in Bulgaria (close to the Troyan Monastery). It has a neat collection of decorative artifacts that make for an interesting collection of photos.

The restaurant is located on the banks of the Beli Osam river.

Across the river, on the other bank, we see an interesting decoration; it is a 2.5D fresco/mural of a house, a man on a donkey, a water wheel, and a wooden window A/C unit. Check it out.

At the entrance to the restaurant is a wooden cannon made from the trunk of a cherry tree.

To the right is an outdoor chapel that looks a lot like a small temple in rural india.
