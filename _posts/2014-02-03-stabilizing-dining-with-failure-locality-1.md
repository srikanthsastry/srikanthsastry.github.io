<strong>Abstract:</strong>Â We propose two algorithm for solving self-stabilizing dining with Crash Locality 1 in asynchronous shared-memory systems with safe registers. Since this problem cannot be solved in pure asynchrony, we augment the shared-memory system with failure detectors. Specifically, we introduce the anonymous eventually perfect failure detector ?&lt;&gt;P (a variant of the anonymous perfect failure detector introduced by Guerraoui et al.), and show that this failure detector is sufficient to solve the problem at hand.
