  I am Srikanth Sastry. I am currently an engineering lead at [Meta](https://meta.com) working on privacy infrastructure. Before joining Facebook, I was a software engineer at Google in Cambridge, MA, and before that I was a postdoctoral associate with Nancy Lynch at [CSAIL, MIT](https://csail.mit.edu). Prior to that, I received my PhD from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu).


  My professional interests include distributed system design, software engineering processes, and building engineering teams.
  

  In a previous life, during my years in academia, I worked on distributed systems, networking, fault tolerance, and algorithm design and analysis. My list of publications are available on [DBLP](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/s/Sastry:Srikanth).
